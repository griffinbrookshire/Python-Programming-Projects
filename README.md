# Python-Programming-Projects
A collection of Python projects, from an automata and grammar class at NC State

1. DynamicProgramming contains short python programs that use dynamic programming to solve simple problems.
    Includes finding a factorial, optimal parenthesis for matrix multiplication, and number of operations in a matrix
    multiplication.
    
2. SentimentAnalysis takes in a set list of 'postive'/'negative' lexicons,
